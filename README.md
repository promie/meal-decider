# Meal Decider

An intermediate project constructed from my own idea.
Using the JS method Math.random(), that returns a randomly selected item from an Object Array.

### About the App
This app gives a recommendation on what to eat with an additional information on the nutritional facts, calories and the recommendations of Restaurants.
