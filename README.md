# Meal Decider

An intermediate project constructed from my own idea.
Using the JS method Math.random(), that returns a randomly selected item from an Object Array.

# About the App
The result returns a recommendation on what to eat to the user with the extra nutritional information, as well as the calories information. There are also hyperlinks of the recommendation restaurants based on the randomly selected food name.
